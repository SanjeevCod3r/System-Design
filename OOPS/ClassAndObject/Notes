OOPS-->
Object Oriented Programming System/Structure
-> OOP is a Programming Paradigm or Methodology
-> Small Talk is frist Object Oriented Programming Language
6 Main Pillar Of Oops Are:
-> Classes
-> Object and Method
-> Encapsulation
-> Inheritance
-> Polymorphism
-> Abstraction

Class-------->
-> Class is the collection of Objects.
-> Class is not a real world entity. It is just a template or blueprint or prototype
-> Class does not occupy memeory
-> Syntax:
access-modifiers class className{
    -> Method
    -> Constructors
    -> fields
    -> blocks
    -> Nested Class
}

Method------>
-> A set of codes which perform a perticular task 
-> Advantage of methods
1. Code Reusabilitity
2. Code Optimization
-> Syntax:
access-modifiers return-type methodName(parameter-list){

}

Object----->
-> Object is an instance of class
-> Object is real world entity
-> Object occupies memory
-> Object consists of:-
1. Identity --> name 
2. State/Attribute --> color , breed age 
3. Behavior --> bark , eat , sleep , run , jump , play , bark , eat
-> How to create an Object:
1. new Keyword 
2. clone() method
3. newInstance() method
4. factory method
5. deserialization

-> Object Creation with new keyword Step:
1. Declaration : It is declaring name with an object type.
Example:
Animal rocky;
2. Instantiation : This is when memory is allocated for an object. The 'new' keyword used to create the object.
Example:
rocky = new 
3. Initialization : The 'new' keyword is followed by a call to a constructor. This call initialize the new object.
Example:
rocky = new Animal()

Final Syntax: Animal rocky = new Animal();
Call Object Behavior Syntax: rocky.run();



Object Initialization--------------------------->
1.By reference Variable 
2.By Using Method
3.By Using Constructor
