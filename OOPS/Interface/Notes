Interface:
Interface are similar to Abstract Class but having all the method of abstract type.

Interface are the blueprint of the class It specify what a class must do and not how.

1. It is used to achive abstraction
2. It is used to achive multiple inheritance
3. It is used to achive loose coupling (Agr ek ke andr change kroge tho woo durse ko affect nhi krega)

Keyword used: implements

Syntax:
interface InterfaceName{
    
  1.  methods -> abstract , public

  2. fields -> public static final

  3. 8th Version
  default concrete method

  4. public static method

  5. 9th Version
  private method

}

What is Interface ?
* Interface is a mechanism to achieve abstraction in java.
* Interface is similar to abstract class but having all the methods of abstract type i.e. it cannot have a method body.
* Since Java 8, we can have default and static methods in an interface.
* Since Java 9, we can have private methods in an interface.

2. Why use Java interface?
1. It is used to achieve abstraction.
2. By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
3. It can be used to achieve loose coupling

Syntax:
interface InterfaceName{
    // constants fields
    //abstract methods
}

Q. Similirities b/w Abstract class and interface
1. Both can contain abstract method.
2. We can not create an instance of abstract class and interfaces.
