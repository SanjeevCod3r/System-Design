Encapsulation:
Encapsulation in java is a mechanism of wrapping the data(variables) and code acting on the data (method)
together as a single unit.
This mechanism allows you to control access to the data, making your code more secure, maintainable, and modular(design principle)

Step to achieve Encapsulation:
1. Declare the variable of a class as private.
2. Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the value of the variable.


In Encapsulation the variable of a class will be hidden from other classes. and can be accessed only through the
methods of their current class. This concept is known as Data Hiding.
