Inheritance:
Inheritance is the procedure by which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors
of a parent object.
(OR)
Inheriting the properties of parent class into child class

Keyword: extends
IS-A -> Realtionship(Parent-Child relationShip)

Advantage:
-> Code Reusebility
-> It promote runtime polymorphism by allowing method overriding

Disadvantage:
-> the two classes (base and inherited class) get tightly coupled

Types of Inheritance:
1. Single Inheritance -> Java
One class extends another class (One class Only)
2. Multilevel Inheritance -> Java
One class can inherit from a derived class. Hence, the derived class become the base class
for the new class.
3. Hierarchical Inheritance -> Java
One class is inherited by many sub classes.
4. Multiple Inheritance -> Not in Java
(Java disallows Multiple inheritance to avoid the complexity and ambiguity associated with it, particularly the "Diamond Problem" where a class inherits from two classes that have a common ancestor, leading to conflicts in the inheritance of methods.)
5. Hybrid Inheritance -> Not in Java (Dimond Problem)

Some Property are Not Inherit:(Imp Interview)
1. Constructor (becase constructor is not a part of class)
2. private Accesbility

Important Point:
Every Class has a Super or say Parent Class
i.e Object class(but object class does not have any parent class)
