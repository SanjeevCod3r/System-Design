Concrete method:
is a method that has a complete implementation, meaning it's not abstract and can be directly called or invoked. 
Definition:
A concrete method is a method that provides a full definition, including the code that will be executed when the method is called. 
Example:
    Concrete method --->>
    // public void myMethod() {
    //     System.out.println("This is a concrete method.");
    // }
