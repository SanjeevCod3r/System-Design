Abstraction:
Abstraction is hiding internal implementation & just highlighting the setup services that we offering
Example:
As in the car case, relevant parts like stearing, gear, horn, accelerator, breaks etc are shown to 
driver because they arenecessary for driving. But the driver need not know the internal functioning of
engine, gear etc. Thus, showing relevant data to the user and hiding implementation or details from the
user is Abstraction


In Java We Achive Abstraction By Two Ways:
1. By Using Abstract Class (0-100%)
2. By Using Interface (100% Achive)


1. A method Without body (No Implementation) is know as abstract method.
2. A method must alawyas be declared in an abstract class, or we can say that if a class has abstract method, 
it should be declared abstract as well.
3. If a regular class extends an abstract class, than the class must have to implement all the abstract method of
abstract class or it has to be declared abstract as well.
4. Abstract method in an abstract class are meant to be overridden in derived concrete classes otherwise compile
time error will be thrown.
5. Abstract class cannot be instantiated means we can't create an object of Abstract class. (Important)
